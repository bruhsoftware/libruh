# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## **BTW React Native prefers Yarn so just use yarn to make it work**

## Step 1: Start the Expo server

First, you will need to start **Expo**.

To start expo, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm run start
```

Then, when open, switch to Expo Go mode for testing the App.

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Expo run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
